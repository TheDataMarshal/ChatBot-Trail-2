# ChatBot-Trail-2

Well, today was a failed attempt to create something. But I learned about Regular Expressions. Although not in much depth which I plan to do tomorrow. I am facing some issues now, in the function I have defined in my jupyter notebook. Only the 1st return statement is running which is weird because the online course I am following to leanr this chatbot have a perfect output. 

Here is the link to the wonderful course that they have created. The website is Datacamp.com and I am kinda happy I came across it. 

Anyway, let's find a way to solve our issue, learn more about regular expressions tomorrow. 

See ya!
